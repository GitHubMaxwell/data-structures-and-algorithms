# CHALLENGE 01: Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
reverse the elements of the given array

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
this is a function that takes in an array, creates a new empty array and pushes the orignal array reversed into it.

# CHALLENGE 02: Insert and shift middle index of array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
make a function that takes in an array and a value, inserts the value into the middle of the array, and returns that array. the function first finds the middle of the array and defines a new array. with two parameters (array, val) the for loop checks the iteration i against the "middle" variable and when it matches it inserts the val there and returns the new array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

# CHALLENGE 03: Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
built the BinarySearch function to take in the desired inputs. we go through each element in a for loop checking to see if the element currently iterated on equals the second parameter value. if it does, pass the index of that value, if it never finds a match, return -1

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

# CHALLENGE 04: ADJACENT PRODUCT
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
build the LargestProduct function that takes in a 2D array and returns the largest product between neighboring values in the matrix (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called LargestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.

# CHALLENGE 07: Linked List Kth From End
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
need to create a link list constructor class along with method to do the desired search action

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create a linked list class that has a method to append nodes simply to have something to work with and a method used to search for specific nodes in the linke list and return the value

# CHALLENGE 08: Linked List Merge
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
write a funciton that takes in two linklists in aas arguments and combines them in a zipper pattern and then returns back that new linklist 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# CHALLENGE 09: Linked List Detect Loop
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
write class method called hasLoop that takes no arguments and returns a boolean telling you if the LinkList your testing is circular or not

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a method for the Linked List class called hasLoop which takes no arguments. Return a boolean that indicates whether or not a circular reference or loop is present in the linked list. Your implementation must not use any additional memory or modify the nodes of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the standard properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
