# CHALLENGE 02: Insert and shift middle index of array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
make a function that takes in an array and a value, inserts the value into the middle of the array, and returns that array. the function first finds the middle of the array and defines a new array. with two parameters (array, val) the for loop checks the iteration i against the "middle" variable and when it matches it inserts the val there and returns the new array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

# CHALLENGE 03: Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
built the BinarySearch function to take in the desired inputs. we go through each element in a for loop checking to see if the element currently iterated on equals the second parameter value. if it does, pass the index of that value, if it never finds a match, return -1

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

# CHALLENGE 04: ADJACENT PRODUCT
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
build the LargestProduct function that takes in a 2D array and returns the largest product between neighboring values in the matrix (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called LargestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.
